# SQL-Journey

Welcome to my **SQL Journey Repository!**

I am starting this repository in **January 2025** to track my daily progress and mastery of SQL. This repository showcases my journey in mastering SQL concepts through practice problems and real-world projects. Solutions are categorized by difficulty levels and topics, alongside projects that demonstrate practical applications.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into difficulty-based folders, further sorted by topics:
